***** Improvements and Bug Fixes *****
------------------------
1) On Mac, when adding a bank the MM/DD/YYYY textField is cut off with an Ellipses...
		-- Simply make the window slightly larger in order to also increase the size of the textField.
		-- Should fix the problem for Mac, and be hardly noticable on Windows
2) Some fonts are not showing up on Mac
		-- Research and choose different fonts that are available on both Windows and Mac
		-- Bookmark on Chrome has the list
3) Add an effect whenever the mouse hovers over a button

***** Features and Functionality to Add *****
---------------------------------------------
1) Make the "Delete CD" button work properly
		-- Make sure to find and delete the proper lines from the banks.txt file, otherwise it may break the program
2) Allow the User to change their username and password whenever they please
		-- This may require another txt file so as to not get mixed up with banks.txt
		-- find a way to hide this file or encrypt it so that you cant look at usernames and passwords
				>> The same could go for the banks.txt. It should probably be hidden or encrypted
3) Add a simple calculator feature
		-- This way the user doesn't have to actually add a bank
		-- Simply type in the supposed amount, the supposed apy, and term in months
		-- Then return the same information as the bank cd's but no need to save the data in a txt file
